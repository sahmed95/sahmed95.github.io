<h3><strong>Next Generation Computing Lab, Ritsumeikan University</strong></h3>
<h4>(Intern, Dec 2016 - Jan 2017)</h4>
<h4>Guide: Prof. Shigeru Yamashita, NGC Lab</h4>

<p>Worked on the development of a pipeline for optimization of topological quantum circuits starting from the ICM representation (Paler et al., 2015 ). Developed a code for conversion of quantum circuits to the ICM representation and their visualization. <a href="https://github.com/qutip/qutip/pull/603">QuTiP PR</a></p>

<h3><strong>Google Summer of Code 2016, Python Software Foundation</strong></h3>
<h4>(Intern, May 2016 - Aug 2016)</h4>
<h4>Mentor: Dr. Ariel Rokem, Senior Data Scientist, University of Washington eScience Institute</h4>
<p>Developed a <a href="https://gist.github.com/sahmed95/00ae62831078e4edc14fad3093a0a408">python module for Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) reconstruction</a> based on the Intra-voxel Incoherent Motion model (Le Bihan, 84) which was released as part of Dipy - an open source Python package for computational neuroanatomy.</p>

<h3><strong>Quantum Information and Computing Group, HRI, Allahabad</strong></h3>
<h4>(SRF, July 2016 - Aug 2016)</h4>
<h4>Guide: Prof. Ujjwal Sen, Associate ProfessorG, HRI, Allahabad</h4>
<p>Indian Academy of Sciences (IAS) Summer Research Fellow. Studied Quantum Entanglement, measures of classical and quantum correlations and the application of Bell inequalities in Quantum Cryptography. In particular, analysed the E91 protocol (Arthur Ekert, 91) and use of Bell inequalities in device independent quantum cyrptography.</p>

<h3><strong>Computational Biology Group, Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai</strong></h3>
<h4>(Intern, Dec 2015 - Jan 2016)</h4>
<h4>Guide: Prof. Sitabhra Sinha, adjunct faculty of the National Institute of Advanced Studies (NIAS), Bangalore.</h4>

<p>Simulated a Hodgkin Huxley inspired model for electrical signaling in bacterial bio-films using Python. Tested the ability of bacterial bio-films to behave as excitable media by extending the 1D model in the study (Prindle et al, 2015) to 2D and analysing the result of various initial conditions.</p>
